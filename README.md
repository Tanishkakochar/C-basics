# 100 Days of Code in C

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** journey in **C programming**! 🎯  

I’m documenting my daily learning and coding exercises in C. This repository contains solutions, practice programs, and experiments as I progress through the 100-day challenge.

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**  
> I’m still working on completing all 100 days, so some parts may be missing or incomplete. Updates will be added regularly.

## What’s inside

- Folders for each day of coding  
- `.c` files containing programs and exercises  
- Explanations and notes for reference  

## Goals
